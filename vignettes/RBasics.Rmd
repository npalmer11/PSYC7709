```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Loops (ways to automate repetition)

```{r}
# Make a loop do something 3 times
# 1:3 creates a vector with 3 numbers in it, 9,10,11
# the loop will run 3 times, because there are three things to assign to i
for(i in 1:3){
  print("orchid")
}

# show the value of i each step of the loop
for(i in 1:3){
  print(i)
}

# index does not have to be numbers
flowers <- c("daisy","bluebell","petunia","lilly")
for(i in flowers){
  print(i)
}

```

Creates a sequence of numbers -> 1:5 &  #seq(from, to)

```{r}
1:5
seq(from = 1, to = 5)
```

Example of a sum function

```{r}
my_sum <- function(x) {
  sum <- 0
  for(i in x) sum <- sum + i
  return(sum)
}

my_sum(1:666)

```
